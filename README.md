# IPOD
----

This repository contains code for performing IPOD data analysis.
To promote efficient code distribution and analysis reproducibility,
we providea singularity container. For instructions on singularity
container use, see the [Singularity Use](#singularity-use) section below.

## Singularity Use

To use our singularity containers, email schroedj@umich.edu for access to
our Google Shared Drive. Once you are given access to the Shared Drive
you can follow [this link][singularity-link]. The version of the singularity
container with the most up-to-date code is in the "current" folder. Older
versions of the container can be found in the "archive" folder.
